# Simple Tools for DNA Sequence Investigation
This is a simple program produced to allow investigation of DNA sequences. Produced for use with _Rubus idaeus_ (red raspberry) sequences, to a comercially important crop with little known surrounding the features of the genomes, it is also effective with a wide range of DNA sequences from other organisms, although it has only been tested with eukaryotic DNA sequences so far.
